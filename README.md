## Surface

The project's style matches the company's branding, playful, colourful and helpful.

### Colour Scheme

I used Contrast Ratio to test the accessibility of my [colours](https://contrast-ratio.com/#%23000000-on-%23EFBDEB) for the text and background colour if image failed to load and these [colours](https://contrast-ratio.com/#%2363185C-on-%23effded) for the heading and enquire button text and background colour. For the backgrounds I chose #EFBDEB and #EFFDED as both are extremly bright and playful which I want anyone who uses the site to get instantly, I used the text colour of #63185C as I didn't want something boring for the header however I couldn't have it be too colourful to the point it wouldn't be readable.

I also used a image as my background with multiple colors, to allow accessibility I added a background of rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7); with a text colour of #000000, No matter what colour of text I used be it black, white or pink it would all be un-accessable due to the multitude of colours in all of the potential background images I had, I was originally planning to put the text blocks into boxes like the enquire button however my Mentor guided in the direction of using a background lacking opacity to fix the accessability.

### Font

[Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat?query=caveat) was my chosen font for the Navigation, subhead, enquire button and price. While browsing for a font which completely encompassed my company's style branding, I came across Caveat over a single glance was instantly recognisable to the eye. The font style is both playful and eyecatching while not being too hard too read. I orginally had this font for the whole website however I decided it would be for helpful to have a softer and less playful style for the text outside of the navigation and sub-head.

[Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=rale) was the font I used for text, contact and lists. After realising my text was blending in due to how playful Caveat was all over the page I decided to find a new font to go well with it, I found Raleway and Montserrat but ended going on with Raleway as it felt softer and balanced out well with Caveat.


### Images

All images were sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). The image chosen for the background was chosen as it showed off the beauty and style of our company through the cake. All other images in the gallery were chosen as they showcased a wide variety of styles to show the customers that any cake they can dream of can be made for them. All images contained a cake and showed off a wide range of colours.

## Features

### Navigation Bar

Each page has a fixed navigation bar in the header. **This will allow the new users a grasp off what's to come in the site as well as quick access for returning users.** As the header is fixed, the navigation bar as well as title will follow the users scrolling. The navigation bar will also have a bar underneath at all times to indicate what page of the site the user is on and will flash with a bar when a different navigation is hover over.

### Enquire Form

To get to the enquire form users will be able to click on the navigation bar which is always infront of them due to it be fixed or at the bottom of every page except the enquire and enquire-confirmation page will be a enquire box link to send the user to the enquire page.

**The enquire form will allow users to enter their personal details such as name(required), email(required) and phone number(not required) as well as information about their dream cake(required)**, this will form a connection between the company and the user to start the promised service. This form after everything required is filled out can be submitted and will lead to our enquire-confirmation page.

Orginally I had decided to have all forms be required however I decided to only go with email as I was worried this could deter any users who felt like we were trying to a lot of the users personal information.

### Footer

Each footer Will contain social media(Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok) and our business email. **This is so that customers have numerous options to be able to get in touch with us be for problems with our service or just to ask questions.**

### Responsive Layout

With the use of flexbox and media queries, **the site's design is responsive too all screen sizes.** Breakpoints have been implemented to vary sizes and positions of content so that they fit more in line with the new extra space alloted with the new size.

When trying to make the images in the gallery responsive I cam upon a problem with flex box where due to the number of images the last image would stretch up to 3 images wide causing a drastic drop in quality, as such I implemented a flex grow of 0 which while make the quality of all images be much better.
