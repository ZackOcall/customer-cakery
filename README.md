## Surface

The project's style matches the company's branding, playful, colourful and helpful.

### Colour Scheme

I used Contrast Ratio to test the accessibility of my colours [Link](https://contrast-ratio.com/#%23000000-on-%23EFBDEB) for the text and background colour if image failed to load and [Link](https://contrast-ratio.com/#%2363185C-on-%23effded) for the heading and enquire button text and background colour. For the backgrounds I chose #EFBDEB and #EFFDED as both are extremly bright and playful which I want anyone who uses the site to get instantly, I used the text colour of #63185C as I didn't want something boring for the header however I couldn't have it be too colourful to the point it wouldn't be readable.

I also used a image as my background with multiple colors, to allow accessibility I added a background of rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7); with a text colour of #000000, No matter what colour of text I used be it black, white or pink it would all be un-accessable due to the multitude of colours in all of the potential background images I had, I was originally planning to put the text blocks into boxes like the enquire button however my Mentor guided in the direction of using a background lacking opacity to fix the accessability.

### Font

[Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat?query=caveat) was my chosen font for the Navigation, subhead, enquire button and price. While browsing for a font which completely encompassed my company's style branding, I came across Caveat over a single glance was instantly recognisable to the eye. The font style is both playful and eyecatching while not being too hard too read. I orginally had this font for the whole website however I decided it would be for helpful to have a softer and less playful style for the text outside of the navigation and sub-head.

[Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=rale) was the font I used for text, contact and lists. After realising my text was blending in due to how playful Caveat was all over the page I decided to find a new font to go well with it, I found Raleway and Montserrat but ended going on with Raleway as it felt softer and balanced out well with Caveat.
